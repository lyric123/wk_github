# Build environment for Git for Windows

This is the build environment -- also known as msysGit -- for [Git for Windows](http://msysgit.github.io/).

The easiest way is to install it via the [net installer](http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/list?q=netinstall). This installer will clone our [two](http://github.com/msysgit/msysgit) [repositories](http://github.com/msysgit/git), including all the necessary components to build Git for Windows, and perform an initial build.
